RMSE for user 16355: 2.311753

The output of parallelALS are two matrices U and M whose product is an 
approximation of your input matrix.

The matrices are outputed as sequence files with an IntWritable as key 
(the index of the row in the matrix) and a VectorWritable as value which 
holds the contents of the row vector.
